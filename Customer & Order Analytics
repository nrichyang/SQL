#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT 
    COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT 
    COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
    AND Product = 'iPhone';
    
#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT 
    DISTINCT c.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f
    ON c.order_id = f.orderId
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT 
    Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY Price
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT 
    Product,
    SUM(Quantity) * Price AS Total_Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
    SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity,
    Product,
    SUM(Quantity) * Price TotalRevenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales   
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
    AND location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum) AcctNum,
    AVG(Quantity) * price AverageSpend
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
    ON f.orderid = c.order_id
WHERE f.quantity > 2
    AND length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
