#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT 
    COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT 
    COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
    AND Product = 'iPhone';
    
#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT 
    DISTINCT c.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f
    ON c.order_id = f.orderId
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT 
    Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY Price
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT 
    Product,
    SUM(Quantity) * Price AS Total_Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT

FROM BIT_DB.FebSales   
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum) AcctNum,
    AVG(Quantity) * price AverageSpend
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
    ON f.orderid = c.order_id
WHERE f.quantity > 2
